        <p class="bio">
            I am a scientist and project team leader at Ksilink specializing in stem cell-based disease modelling, 
            phenotypic screening and high-content image data analysis. I have a MSc in biotechnology and a PhD in 
            cell biology, and did a postdoctoral work in neuroscience. I am currently driving multiple projects using 
            stem cell-derived cortical, motor, and dopaminergic neurons as well as microglia for drug screening using 
            microscopic and functional assays. I work with academic and industry partners in multiple countries to 
            increase the translational value of stem cell models. I enjoy managing diverse and interdiciplinary teams 
            of biologists and data scientists. I want to learn something new every day. I love talking about cell 
            biology, machine learning, data visualization, Python, running, and home improvement.
